# SpeechPilot

A native Android application that provides real-time speech pace feedback to help speakers maintain a comfortable, clear delivery.

All processing runs locally on-device. No backend, cloud, or external services required.

---

## Project Status

🚧 **Iteration 1 — Scaffold** — Module structure and interfaces in place. Feature implementation begins in Iteration 2.

---

## Architecture

SpeechPilot is structured as a multi-module Android project. Each module has a single, focused responsibility.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `app` | Application entry point, wiring |
| `ui` | Compose screens, ViewModels |
| `session` | Session lifecycle orchestration |
| `audio` | Microphone capture, `AudioFrame` emission |
| `vad` | Voice activity detection |
| `segmentation` | Speech segment buffering |
| `pace` | Rate estimation, rolling metrics |
| `feedback` | Decisioning and feedback events |
| `data` | Persistence (Room, repositories) |
| `settings` | User configuration (DataStore) |

See [docs/phase1_architecture.md](docs/phase1_architecture.md) for the full architecture description.

## Conventions

- **Kotlin-only** source files, idiomatic Kotlin style
- **Sealed classes** for state and event modeling
- **Coroutines + Flow** for all async and streaming work
- **No business logic in Composables or ViewModels** beyond UI state orchestration
- **Local-first**: no network calls, no analytics
